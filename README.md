This crate implements the server half of the web push API, in Rust!

For more background on the web push framework itself, please
reference [this excellent document.](https://web.dev/notifications/)

## Requirements

- Clients require an async executor.
- OpenSSL is required for compilation. You must install it on your host or use the `vendored` feature of the [openssl](https://docs.rs/openssl/) crate.

## Migration notes

This library is still in active development, and will have breaking changes in accordance with semver. Please view the
GitHub release notes for detailed notes.

Example
--------

```rust
use web_push::*;
use std::fs::File;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync + 'static>> {
    let endpoint = "https://updates.push.services.mozilla.com/wpush/v1/...";
    let p256dh = "key_from_browser_as_base64";
    let auth = "auth_from_browser_as_base64";

    //You would likely get this by deserializing a browser `pushSubscription` object via serde.  
    let subscription_info = SubscriptionInfo::new(
        endpoint,
        p256dh,
        auth
    );

    //Read signing material for payload.
    let file = File::open("private.pem").unwrap();
    let mut sig_builder = VapidSignatureBuilder::from_pem(file, &subscription_info)?.build()?;

    //Now add payload and encrypt.
    let mut builder = WebPushMessageBuilder::new(&subscription_info);
    let content = "Encrypted payload to be sent in the notification".as_bytes();
    builder.set_payload(ContentEncoding::Aes128Gcm, content);
    builder.set_vapid_signature(sig_builder);

    let client = IsahcWebPushClient::new()?;

    //Finally, send the notification!
    client.send(builder.build()?).await?;
    Ok(())
}
 ```

VAPID
-----

VAPID authentication prevents unknown sources sending notifications to the client and is required by all current
browsers when sending a payload.

The private key to be used by the server can be generated with OpenSSL:

```
openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -out private_key.pem
```

To derive a public key from the just-generated private key, to be used in the JavaScript client:

```
openssl ec -in private_key.pem -pubout -outform DER|tail -c 65|base64|tr '/+' '_-'|tr -d '\n'
```

The signature is created with `VapidSignatureBuilder`. It automatically adds the required claims `aud` and `exp`. Adding
these claims to the builder manually will override the default values.

## Using the example program

To send a web push from command line, first subscribe to receive push notifications with your browser and store the
subscription info into a json file. It should have the following content:

``` json
{
  "endpoint": "https://updates.push.services.mozilla.com/wpush/v1/TOKEN",
  "keys": {
    "auth": "####secret####",
    "p256dh": "####public_key####"
  }
}
```

Google has
[good instructions](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/push-notifications/subscribing-a-user) for building a
frontend to receive notifications.

Store the subscription info to `examples/test.json` and send a notification with
`cargo run --example simple_send -- -v ./private_key.pem -f examples/test.json -p "It works!"`.

Overview
--------

Currently, the crate implements
[RFC8188](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8188) content encryption for notification payloads. This is done by
delegating encryption to mozilla's [ece crate](https://crates.io/crates/ece). Our security is thus tied
to [theirs](https://github.com/mozilla/rust-ece/issues/18). The default client is built
on [isahc](https://crates.io/crates/isahc), but can be swapped out with a hyper based client using the
`hyper-client` feature. Custom clients can be made using the `request_builder` module.

Library tested with Google's and Mozilla's push notification services. Also verified to work on Edge.

Openssl is needed to build. Install `openssl-dev` or equivalent on *nix, or `openssl` using `vcpkg` on Windows. A nix
script is also available.

If installing on Windows, this is the exact command:

```shell
vcpkg integrate install
vcpkg install openssl:x64-windows-static-md
```

Debugging
--------
If you get an error or the push notification doesn't work you can try to debug using the following instructions:

Add the following to your Cargo.toml:

```cargo
log = "0.4"
pretty_env_logger = "0.3"
```

Add the following to your main.rs:

```rust
extern crate pretty_env_logger;

// ...
fn main() {
    pretty_env_logger::init();
    // ...
}
```

Or use any other logging library compatible with https://docs.rs/log/

Then run your program with the following environment variables:

```bash
RUST_LOG="web_push::client=trace" cargo run
```

This should print some more information about the requests to the push service which may aid you or somebody else in
finding the error.
